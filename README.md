## Incident Summary
- Customers reported being **redirected to greatrecipesforme.com** and prompted to download a ‚Äúfree recipe.‚Äù  
- Downloaded file caused **slow system performance** and **redirected browsers** to a malicious domain.  
- Website owner was **locked out of the admin panel** after the attacker reset the password.  
- Sandbox testing with **tcpdump** confirmed the malicious behavior.

- **DNS** ‚Äì Resolved yummyrecipesforme.com and greatrecipesforme.com to IP addresses.  
- **HTTP** ‚Äì Used to request web pages and download the malicious executable.  
- **HTTPS** ‚Äì Not enforced; should be implemented to protect against tampering.  

## Attack Sequence
1. DNS request for yummyrecipesforme.com

3. HTTP request for webpage  
4. Download of malicious executable  
5. DNS request for greatrecipesforme.com

7. HTTP request to malicious site  

**Root Cause:** Default admin password + no brute force protections ‚Üí attacker gained access, embedded malicious JavaScript, and reset credentials.  

## Recommended Remediations
- Enforce **HTTPS-only (TLS + HSTS)**  
- Remove all **default/weak credentials**  
- Require **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**  
- Apply **rate-limiting & account lockouts** for failed logins  
- **Restrict admin panel access** (VPN/IP allowlists)  
- Regular **patching & updates** (OS, CMS, plugins)  
- Implement **monitoring & integrity controls** (e.g., CSP, SRI)  

## üìù Note
End-user awareness messaging (e.g., ‚ÄúWe will never ask you to download executables‚Äù) can be useful, but **secure web design and server hardening** are the primary defenses.
